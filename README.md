<h1>Stock Market Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques</h1>
Abstract
Traditional stock market prediction methods often rely on assumptions and conventional approaches, but the emergence of deep learning techniques offers a transformative opportunity. This study evaluates the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures, including LSTM networks, CNNs, GRU, Bi-directional GRU, and Federated Learning in forecasting stock prices. Through rigorous experimentation and assessment using key metrics such as Loss, MAE, MSE, MAPE, and RMSE, deep learning models, particularly LSTM networks and CNNs, demonstrate notable improvements in accuracy compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the study explores the interpretability of these models, providing insights into the complex dynamics influencing stock price fluctuations. Introducing a novel approach, the study aims to predict future stock prices of Cipla by integrating various financial indicators from annual reports. Leveraging BiLSTM, CNN, Linear Regression, and Federated Learning, this comprehensive methodology seeks to offer investors reliable insights for informed decision-making in navigating the intricacies of the stock market.
